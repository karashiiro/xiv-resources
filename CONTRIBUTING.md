# Contributing
Thank you for contributing! Here are a few guidelines to follow before you post:

Just some quick NOs:
* No Discord (or other chat) servers - There are a million of them. Likewise for forums. Websites that *have* a forum or a server associated with them are perfectly fine, as long as the website is not only a means of having people join a forum/server.
* No chat bots - They're easy to make, and there are tons of them.
* No TexTools mods - See above. Exceptions might be made for UI mods.
* No Dalamud plugins that are in the plugin repository already.
* No XIVAPI clients that are on the official website already.

The exception to all of this is that I *will* accept aggregators of the above. For example, [XIV Mod Archive](https://www.xivmodarchive.com/) is linked, but specific mods are not.

"Cheating" software will be added at my own discretion; what crosses that line will be decided very arbitrarily.

## Sorting
Entries within each table should be alphabetized, respecting spaces but not punctuation.

For example:

✅ Good:

Name|Description
---|---
ACT CPlugin|(No description)
ACT Thing|(No description)
ACT_APlugin|(No description)
ACTBPlugin|(No description)

❌ Bad (respect spaces!):
Name|Description
---|---
ACT Thing|(No description)
ACT_APlugin|(No description)
ACTBPlugin|(No description)
ACT CPlugin|(No description)
